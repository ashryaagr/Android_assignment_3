Create an android app that has a navigation drawer.

The Drawer will have a profile image and name holder at the top(similar to Gmail). The menu items(total 5) will be - Primary, Send, Contact, About, Help. The bottom will have copyright info showing that the app is the property of CSD Course.

You will create 5 Fragments each corresponding to one item on the menu. Clicking on the menu items should allow the user to navigate through all the fragments. 

Primary Fragment - This will have a bottom navigation menu. No need for allowing clicks on the items in this bottom menu. Just implement it UI wise. 

Send Fragment - This will have 2 edit texts, one as mail ID of the receiver and another as content. There will be a floating action button with the send icon beside the content edit text. 

Contact Fragment - This will be a simple list view with any 3 fake contact items.

About Fragment - This will have a simple text view with some random information about the app

Help Fragment - This will have 2 buttons - Call for Help and Start Chat buttons.
